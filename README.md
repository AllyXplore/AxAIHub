## What is AxAIHub

AxAIHub is the **AI hub of your Android phone** — far more than a chat interface. It is a unified platform where an AI assistant sits at the center of a suite of on-device tools — office documents, image editing, file management, project boards, notes, and small utilities — and can **directly operate them** through a local tool bus, with no cloud relay required.

Unlike most AI apps that are thin chat wrappers around cloud APIs, AxAIHub is built around a fundamentally different philosophy: **everything that can run locally, runs locally.** Cloud AI providers are entirely optional — you bring your own credentials and endpoints, or you run models fully offline using the on-device engine.

The app is built with **Tauri 2.0**, combining a native Android shell with a web-based UI layer, delivering a responsive experience while maintaining full access to device capabilities.

**Built-in depth that grows with you.** AxAIHub ships with a 35+ tool system across 9 capability domains, and its **runtime integration interface** lets you plug your own execution environments in on top of the runtimes already bundled (Python 3.11 built in, Termux optional) — the ceiling is set by you, not by us. System-level access (Shizuku/Root) stays strictly opt-in for those who need it. Automation and deeper system capabilities remain firmly on our roadmap — they take long-term refinement to build right, and restraint like skipping blind screen-tapping is a compliance choice for the long haul, not a lack of ambition.

## Architecture Overview

AxAIHub's architecture is designed around a **local tool bus** pattern, connecting the AI engine with all on-device tools through a unified command layer:

## Key Features

### Built-in Tool System — 35+ tools, 9 capability domains

The AI doesn't just chat — it can **actually operate your phone** through a 35+ built-in tool system, grouped into 9 capability domains:

- **Web & Information (5)**: live web search, file-content search (grep), filename search, chat-attachment reading, audio extraction
- **File Operations (7)**: create / edit (full-file and line-level) / read / list / delete / rename / move files on your device
- **Terminal & Execution (2)**: full terminal (BusyBox 300+ commands, Android Shell, Termux) and Python execution
- **Multi-Agent Concurrency (2)**: concurrent multi-AI dispatch, parallel multi-tool scheduling
- **Image (2)**: on-device photo editing (filters & adjustments) and AI image generation
- **Tasks & Schedule (5)**: structured task plans (create/add/update), scheduled reminders with auto AI execution, structured question cards
- **Text & Encoding (12)**: base64, hash, timestamp, UUID, password, JSON, encode (10 formats), JWT, regex, text layout, text coloring, feedback
- **MCP (1+)**: external tool servers via the MCP protocol
- **Plugin System**: third-party plugin calling

This is the deepest on-device tooling available to an AI agent on Android — your assistant can search the web, write code, edit files, run terminals, and orchestrate multiple AI models in parallel, all on your phone.

### AI Assistant
- Works with any cloud AI provider you configure (OpenAI-compatible APIs, local inference endpoints)
- **Fully offline on-device engine** — download a model once, run inference locally with no network
- Semantic routing: automatically selects the best model for each task
- Concurrent multi-AI orchestration: dispatch sub-tasks to different models in parallel
- Context compression, memory management, and long-term recall

### Office Suite
- **Documents**: Rich text editing with Markdown support, rendered with KaTeX math and Mermaid diagrams
- **Tables**: Spreadsheet functionality with formulas and formatting
- **Notes**: Quick capture with media attachments
- **Text utilities**: OCR, format conversion, encoding/decoding tools
- **File conversion**: Between common document formats

### Image Editor
- On-device image editing with filters, adjustments, and effects
- Layout tools, crop, rotate, and export
- Project-based photo organization with galleries
- Supports common image formats

### File & Project Management
- Full file manager with breadcrumb navigation
- Project boards with per-day working files
- Folder and file operations (create, rename, move, delete)
- Multi-level directory tree with collapse/expand
- Built-in archive and backup support

### Terminal & Developer Tools
- Full terminal emulator with three execution layers:
  - **BusyBox** (300+ built-in commands, bundled with the app)
  - **Android Shell** (system commands)
  - **Termux** (optional, full Linux environment)
- Code editor with syntax highlighting (CodeMirror)
- NexusScript reference documentation

### Utilities
- Voice input with multi-engine support
- QR code scanning
- Floating ball quick-access overlay
- Small games (2048, Go board)
- Scheduled reminders with alarm manager persistence
- Text-to-speech (TTS) with auto-reading

## Feature Integration: How Everything Works Together

What makes AxAIHub different is not the individual features, but how they are **woven together** through the AI assistant:

### AI + Office
The AI assistant can directly create, edit, and format documents. You can say "summarize this document into a table" and the AI will open the office tool, create the table, and populate it — all without you switching apps.

### AI + Image Editor
The AI can describe what edits to make, or the image editor can feed visual context back to the AI for analysis. Ask "remove the background from this photo" and the AI routes the request to the appropriate tool.

### AI + File Manager
The AI navigates your file system, organizes projects, and manages backups. "Archive last month's project files" triggers the file manager through the tool bus.

### AI + Terminal
The AI can execute terminal commands, interpret output, and suggest next steps. This creates a powerful development workflow: describe what you want to build, and the AI handles the command-line work.

### AI + Plugin System
Third-party plugins register their capabilities with the tool bus. The AI discovers and invokes them dynamically, extending its reach to whatever functionality plugins provide.

### Cross-Feature Workflows
A single user request can cascade through multiple tools:
1. User: "Create a project report from last week's notes, add charts, and save it as PDF"
2. AI parses intent, calls the file manager to locate notes
3. Routes to the office tool to compile the document
4. Invokes the image editor to generate charts
5. Exports the final PDF

All of this happens **on-device**, with no data leaving your phone unless you've configured a cloud AI provider.

## Multi-Device Connectivity

AxAIHub supports connecting to other devices through multiple channels:

### Bluetooth Devices
- Pair with wearables, smart bands, and IoT devices
- Cross-device control: send commands from your phone, receive sensor data
- Health data integration from connected wearables

### Nearby WiFi
- Discover and connect to devices on the same network
- File sharing between AxAIHub instances
- Collaborative editing across devices

### Phone-to-Phone
- Direct connection between two AxAIHub instances
- Shared clipboard and task delegation
- Synchronized AI context across devices

All connections are **encrypted and peer-to-peer**. There is no central server, and your data never passes through a third-party relay.

---

## Privacy & Data Sovereignty

- **No account required.** Core features work without any login or registration.
- **No telemetry.** The app collects no usage statistics, crash reports, or analytics.
- **No data upload.** Your conversations, documents, images, and files stay in local storage.
- **Your AI, your credentials.** If you use a cloud AI provider, requests go directly to the endpoint you configured, under your credentials — never through our infrastructure.
- **Local web service** binds to loopback address only, unreachable from outside the device.

- Permission-by-permission breakdown: [docs/PERMISSIONS.md](docs/PERMISSIONS.md)

## Plugin System

AxAIHub features an **open plugin format** that allows third-party developers to extend the app's capabilities. The plugin system is fully open-source and documented in the [axaihub-plugin-system](https://github.com/AllyXplore/axaihub-plugin-system) repository.

- **Package formats**: plain and encrypted formats
- **Sandbox isolation**: Each plugin runs in its own WebView with a unique origin (axplugin://<plugin-id>), preventing cross-plugin data access
- **Permission model**: Plugins request permissions through Android's native API
- **Resource management**: Inactive plugins are unloaded to prevent memory leaks
- **Lifecycle**: Plugins are loaded on demand and released when not in use

The plugin format specification, packaging CLI (`axbuild`), and complete documentation are open-source at [github.com/AllyXplore/axaihub-plugin-system](https://github.com/AllyXplore/axaihub-plugin-system).
